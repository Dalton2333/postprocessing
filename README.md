# postprocessing
This project is trying to post-process the model from topology optimization.
The model can be 3D but the post-processing works on 2D cross-section.
The smoothing includes spline fitting for external boundary and void replacement for internal voids.
A location optimization method is developed to further optimize the voids locations.
